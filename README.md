The aim of this sytem named “We For Youth” will be to focusing on mental health problems according to the past 
28 years since the genocide against the Tutsi, mental health problems continue to be the greatest challenge facing the Rwandan population. 

After some research with the group we discovered that today's youths are having mental issues caused by loneliness and not having the opportunity to share whats
going on. But no more worries cause we brought you **WE FOR YOUTH** system to avoid that.
